This repo has been tailored for use on the Yartsev Lab Computer 5 Window/Linux machine *~
It is very similar to the folder "batch_process" on Madeleine's Desktop computer under HumanBat/audio.

This repo contains scripts to take raw audio data to clips and save them on Box under "audio_clips".

These clips can then be fed into BioSound. 

HumanBat_visualize_audio_event_aligned_to_flight.m : Script that prompts you to click a segment of data, and will plot all the detected events aligned to flight. If this is a good segment of data, subsequently run this script below;
HumanBat_shortclip_label_and_save.m : Script you run after ^. This script prompts you to listen to the sound segment, label the events you think are real, listen to each of those events, and then label and save them as clips. 

All clips files are saved on Box: 
https://berkeley.app.box.com/folder/245564236690

All audio segments to be examined are on Box:
