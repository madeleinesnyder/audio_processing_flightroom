This repo has been tailored for use on the Yartsev Lab Computer 5 Window/Linux machine *~
It is very similar to the folder "batch_process" on Madeleine's Desktop computer under HumanBat/audio.

This repo contains scripts to take raw audio data to clips and save them on Box under "audio_clips".

These clips can then be fed into BioSound.
